ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification â€“ CodSoft Internship (Task 3)

This project is part of my Data Science Virtual Internship with CodSoft. The objective is to build a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into one of three species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica â€” based on petal and sepal measurements.

ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of pattern recognition. It contains 150 samples with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The aim of this project is to predict the species using supervised machine learning algorithms.
